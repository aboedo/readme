# Working with me

Hi! üëãüèª
If you're reading this, chances are that we're going to work together. I wrote this manager readme to provide you with some context about me and how I work so we can start building great stuff together very quickly. 

Full disclosure: this guide was inspired by a [similar one made by a former manager I had](https://github.com/scottrabin/readme), which I found useful and stuck with me through the years. 

# About me
I'm a software engineer from Uruguay, a little country in South America. I drink mate üßâ (a traditional beverage here, highly caffeinated) pretty much all the time. I've been at RevenueCat since Jan 2020. 

Although I'm currently a manager, I enjoy coding a LOT, and am very happy to nerd out about engineering problems. In past lives I've done a decent amount of backend and infrastructure development with python and ruby and infra with AWS and web development, but in recent years I've been mostly focused on mobile development, especially on iOS but with a mix of technologies and platforms since joining RevenueCat. 

I can't promise to be the best manager you've ever had. But I will certainly try my best. I care deeply about your success and the success of our company and our customers, and will try to find ways for you to grow and to push you to do your best work. 

## Motivations
All I really want is to build things that are useful to others and help them make money. So I always focus on customer impact and their experience, and love hearing the feedback directly from customers. Everything we build together should somehow make someone's life easier, otherwise it's wasted time. 

I am also a nerd at heart. I enjoy having technical discussions of all sorts in all areas of the stack. I'll obviously not be equally familiar in all of them, but I will always enjoy the discussion regardless. I love seeing the results of cool and clever engineering, although ideally it's not too clever (more on that later). 

And I love working with people who are smarter than myself and seeing what they build. 

# What to expect

## Feedback
You should expect lots of feedback, both positive and constructive. I try to deliver feedback privately and as quickly as I notice things, good and bad, big or small. However I will look for just about any excuse to praise you publicly. I am usually a big fan of the people I get to work with, and don't hide that fact. The feedback should be honest, clear and actionable. Sometimes I might naturally tend to water down the message for constructive feedback, and I'm actively working on improving that to make messages as clear as possible. If you don't feel like you're getting enough feedback, that's my fault, and definitely let me know. You should at all times feel like you have a clear picture of how your performance compares to our expectations. Performance reviews should feel like a summary of all the things we've talked about over time, and have no surprises in them. 

Likewise, I hope to get your honest feedback on my own performance, as much as possible. I will do my best to earn your trust to get that feedback, and be hugely thankful to get it.

## Communication
I expect you to communicate what you're working on, how others can help, and whether you will meet deadlines, on a consistent basis. And I expect you to communicate all of that publicly so others are aware. Typically, I would want to be able to know what you're up to without asking, just by reading public communications in slack, github, linear, etc. If I have to ask you what you're up to and how it's progressing, I would consider it a failure and help you improve communications. And DMs should be reserved solely for sensitive communication. 

## 1-1s
1-1s are meant to be your time. If you don't have anything to cover, I will use the time to give you context on the company, customers, industry, etc, and to learn more about you and where you want to go. We will have 1-1s at some fixed cadence, but I will ALWAYS have time for you. If you every want to chat outside our regular schedule, just hit me up, I will make it work. Being able to help you with anything or provide context is of extremely high importance to me. 

## Technical skills
I expect you to be able to perform the technical work for your job OR to be willing and able to learn it. I'm more than happy to guide you. I'm a generalist so I don't tend to be super deep in any particular technology, rather, I end up seeing technology as the specific tool to solve a human's needs, and thus more of an implementation detail. But in general terms I should be able to help you get unstuck with all sorts of things. 

## Task assignment and process
I will typically give you high-level, loosely-defined tasks, and will expect that you can figure out the details or ask. Mixed with that, you will often notice a lot of other work that needs to be done, and I expect you to be able to prioritize urgent vs non-urgent work. When in doubt, you can always ask me. I will also want to hear your ideas for improvements to our products or technology, and will encourage you to spend time trying out your ideas to turn them into real projects. 

We have an [engineering strategy doc](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/engineering/engineering-strategy/) that does a better job of covering our building principles than I could. 

I am a strong believer that process should follow need, so as far as I can possibly manage, I will try to keep the team's process as thin and light as possible. This means no sprints, estimations, task grooming, poker planning, etc. If a concrete need to add a step in the development process arises, I will add it, but then the moment it seems unnecessary I will remove it. 

Lastly, I will consistently try to push you to do bigger and better things, and into uncomfortable territory, and support you along the journey. I will be careful not to fall into a [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) situation, but will still try to help you be your best self. 

## Understanding the problem and the industry
Given that the tasks you will get from me are "high-level, loosely-defined", you will have to make a lot of decisions. To make them effectively, you will have to gain an understanding of the company, our customers and their needs, our products and our position in the market. I consider this to be a part of the job. There are many ways to get this knowledge - talk to customers, listen to podcasts, read our blog posts, dogfood, try building an app, etc. I am happy to guide you here. 

That being said, I can always help make these decisions. I have opinions about literally all things, so I will typically try to let you make the calls, but will be happy to provide my two cents. 

### Turning your ideas into action
Related to the previous point: while working, you will come up with ideas for improving our product, process, technology, etc. I would very much love to help you carry them through! But they need to have a specific purpose that will help a real human (see "Motivations"). 

# Other

Some random mantras you'll hear me repeat often, along with their original inspiration:
- **Paranoia works ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è:** acting a little extra paranoid is often more effective than pretending things are okay. So if you notice something is off, try to understand why before moving on. Or if you're shipping something delicate, be extra methodical, and don't consider it done until you've tested things as a customer would see them. Trademark aside, I blatantly stole the phrase from a blog post in the early 2010's that talked about using common sense as the most effective software antivirus. 
- **Don't kill pandas:** the full phrase is _"Whenever you make a backend request that you don't need, a panda dies. Don't kill pandas"_. I might switch up the "backend" there for some other resource depending on the occasion, but generally it's a reminder to be efficient with resources. This one is came from a website that I used as a guide back in my web development days, where the phrase was about "modifying the DOM without need". 
- **If you don't feel like you're repeating yourself, you're not saying things enough:** this is a reminder that communication is hard, and that everyone has their own things going on, so if you want to effectively communicate a message, you probably should be repeating yourself very clearly quite a few times, otherwise people will forget or entirely miss the message. This one came from Elevate's CEO in my previous job. 
- **Be boring:** When programming, you will often be tempted to use a new bit of fancy tech, crazy fancy pattern, etc. They can often be very fun to write but absolutely miserable to read for a new maintainer. So when coding, I will encourage you to write things in the most obvious, simple and boring way possible. Future you will be thankful, I promise. This phrase came from Aaron, a former peer at Elevate. A related one is "code like the person maintaining it is a serial killer who knows where you live", but I prefer the "boring" version because it's a little less... bloody. 
- **My role is to manage myself out of my role:** stolen from Scott, my former manager who also wrote the readme that inspired this one. It's pretty self-explanatory - I will do my best so that you don't need me at all, which in turn will help you grow and help me focus on other things. Win-win. 
- **Perfect is the enemy of shipped:** comes from RevenueCat's very own SubClub podcast, and is a good reminder that it's better to have something imperfect that's shipped than forever perfecting something that isn't used by real people. A related phrase that I like is "if you're not the least bit embarrassed by what you shipped, you shipped too late". 

## Stuff that I'm working on improving
Technically, everything and anything. Roles are ever-changing and I'm constantly learning. But there are concrete things that I'm actively working on:
- Not watering down constructive messages: mentioned already, but, you know, "repeat yourself". There's a non-zero chance that if I'm giving you constructive feedback, what I really mean is a liiiitle more serious than what I say. I've made some progress on this, but you can always ask for clarification when in doubt. 
- Not providing enough clarity: I intentionally try to give you loosely-defined tasks, but I can certainly cross the line into giving you an impossible task without realizing. There's a phrase in Uruguay that goes something like "sending you to war armed with a fork". If it feels this way, let me know! I'm happy to help at all times. 
- Be too opinionated: Like I said, I have opinions about literally everything. I can come off strongly on them on occasion, so if you feel like your opinion has not been heard, speak up, privately or publicly. The best products are built by teams, not by me, so your opinion matters a lot, most likely you know a better approach than me. 
- This readme! If there's anything here that doesn't seem to reflect how I work, or that feels important for someone working with me to know about, tell me about it so I can improve it!
What else should I be focusing on? I'm deathly scared of my unknown unknowns, so please let me know! Or if you don't feel comfortable enough telling me directly, please tell my manager. I would much rather have my manager scream at me than not knowing what I could be doing better.
